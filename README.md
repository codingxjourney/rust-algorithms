## [Search Algorithms](./src/searching)

- [x] [Linear Search](./src/searching/linear_search.rs): a linear search is a algorithm for finding an element within a list/array. It sequentially checks each element of the list/array until a match is found or the whole list/array has been searched.                                                                                                        
     Best-case scenario: 1                                                   
     Worst-case scenario: n                                                   
     Average-case scenario: (n+1) / 2
