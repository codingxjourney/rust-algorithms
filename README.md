## [Search Algorithms](./src/searching)

- [x] [Linear Search](./src/searching/linear_search.rs): a linear search is a algorithm for finding an element within a array. It sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found or the whole array has been searched.                                                                                                        
     Time Complexity                         
     Best-case scenario: 1                                                   
     Worst-case scenario: n                                                  

- [x] [Linear Search](./src/searching/binary_search.rs): Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.                
     Time Comlexity           
     Best-case scenario: 1                                                   
     Worst-case scenario: log(n)
